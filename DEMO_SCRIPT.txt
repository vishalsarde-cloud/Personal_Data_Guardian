# Personal Data Guardian - 60-Second Demo Script

## Setup (Pre-Demo)
- Have Ganache running with deployed contract
- Backend server running (show terminal)
- Chrome extension loaded and dashboard open
- Demo pages ready in browser tabs

## Live Demo Script (60-90 seconds)

**[0-15s] Problem Introduction**
"Privacy is broken. Users share sensitive data without knowing what's collected or having proof of their consent decisions. Let me show you Personal Data Guardian - blockchain-based privacy transparency."

**[15-30s] Extension Demo**
"Here's a website requesting access to contacts, camera, and location data." 
*[Open sensitive_demo.html]*
"Our Chrome extension automatically detects these requests and shows a consent banner."
*[Point to banner at top]*
"I'll click Reject to deny access."
*[Click Reject button]*

**[30-45s] Blockchain Logging**
"Notice the notification - this decision is now logged to Ethereum blockchain."
*[Show notification popup]*
"Here's our backend terminal showing the transaction being processed."
*[Show backend terminal with transaction logs]*
"Every privacy decision creates an immutable, timestamped record."

**[45-60s] Dashboard & Proof**
"Our dashboard shows all privacy decisions with blockchain proof."
*[Switch to dashboard tab]*
"Here's the decision we just made - with transaction hash, timestamp, and details hash."
*[Point to new entry in table]*
"Users can now prove what they consented to and when."

**[60-75s] Value Proposition**
"This gives users transparency and companies compliance proof. The blockchain makes privacy decisions auditable and tamper-proof."

**[75-90s] Future Vision**
"We're building the infrastructure for privacy transparency - where every data sharing decision is recorded, verifiable, and owned by the user."

## Key Points to Emphasize
- ✅ Real-time detection and consent
- ✅ Blockchain immutability 
- ✅ Privacy-preserving (only hashes on-chain)
- ✅ User ownership of privacy decisions
- ✅ Compliance ready for GDPR/CCPA

## Demo Recovery
If blockchain fails: "We also support offline mode with local storage for development environments."
