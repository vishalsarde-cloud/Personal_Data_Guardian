## Personal Data Guardian - 3-Slide Pitch

### Slide 1: The Problem 🚨
• **Privacy Crisis**: Users unknowingly share sensitive data with websites
• **Lack of Transparency**: No clear record of privacy decisions and data sharing
• **Trust Issues**: Users can't verify what data companies actually collect
• **Regulatory Gap**: Need immutable proof of consent for compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

### Slide 2: Our Solution 🛡️
• **Chrome Extension**: Automatically detects sensitive data requests and shows consent banners
• **Blockchain Logging**: Immutable record of privacy decisions on Ethereum
• **Privacy-Preserving**: Only stores hashed details on-chain, full data stays local
• **Real-Time Dashboard**: Users can view all their privacy decisions and blockchain transactions
• **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable privacy protection system

### Slide 3: Demo & Future Scope 🚀

**Live Demo Flow:**
1. Visit sensitive website → Extension detects keywords → Shows consent banner
2. User decides Approve/Reject → Decision logged to blockchain → Dashboard updates
3. Immutable proof of consent with transaction hash and timestamp

**Future Roadmap:**
• **AI-Powered Detection**: Advanced ML models for better PII recognition
• **Multi-Chain Support**: Polygon, Arbitrum for lower gas costs
• **Browser Integrations**: Firefox, Safari, Edge extensions
• **Enterprise Solution**: Corporate privacy compliance dashboard
• **Monetization**: Premium features, whitelabel solutions, compliance reporting

**Market Opportunity:** $200B privacy tech market growing 25% annually
